# A new fully automatic pure hexahedron mesh, called lotus mesh, generation technique of an arbitrary 2D/3D geometric domain and polyhedral smoothed finite element method for improvement of accuracy are presented. The lotus mesh algorithm proposed in this paper is mainly based on the signed distance function and the density function to place nodes and control node density respectively, then the lotus mesh is obtained by the way of Delauney triangulation and internal division. For the signed distance function and density function, a variety of flexible definition methods are proposed, such as standard tessellation language (STL) definition, Boolean operation, adaptive density grid, etc. In addition, to improve the stability and accuracy of lotus mesh, polyhedral smoothed finite element method based on stabilized nodal integration is proposed. The main idea is to establish polyhedral smoothing domain and exploit stabilized nodal integration to obtain more accurate stiffness matrix. Several demonstration examples are presented to verify the lotus mesh and its accuracy.
